# Solar-Suitcase-Tester
Code for ESW Project (Tester for We Care Solar's Solar Suitcase)
Last year's team had some code written in Python for the Raspberry Pi. The LCD output and reverse polarity tests were either poorly implemented or not written at all. After writing these tests and LCD output in Python, we decided to switch to an Arduino because the GPIO for the Pi is very slow. We are converting the Python code to C for Arduino.
